1. One plain text file, with sections for each part of this assignment. (This is
so that it is possible to see which part of the file answers which question.)
Include all programs you have written. Make sure you comment your
code so that what you are doing can be understood. Do not submit a
Word document or a PDF fileâ€”only submit a plain text file.
2. The output of each task stored in HDFS and named as sXXXXXXX task i.out
2. The output of each task stored in HDFS and named as sXXXXXXX task i.out
2. The output of each task stored in HDFS and named as sXXXXXXX task i.out
where XXXXXXX is your matriculation number and i is the number of the
task the folder corresponds to. Do not delete these files from HDFS until
you are told it is OK to do so.
Your text file submission should be named exc-mr.txt. Organise your file

i results end for task i. The result block should contain the first 20 lines of
your first output file that you have stored in HDFS. This is because the output
files will be very big. You can use the command:
hdfs dfs -cat filename | head -20
for showing just the first 20 lines of the file. An example submission file should
therefore look like:
